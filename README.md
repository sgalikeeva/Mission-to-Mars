# Mission to Mars:

## Overview
Using BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.

## Results
First, BeautifulSoup and Splinter were used to crape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images. Second, the code that was previously created which scraped the images was added to the scraping.py file, the Mongo database was updated and the index.html file was modified so the webpage contains all the need information. The web app was then edited to make it mobile responsive and additional Bootstrap 3 components were added.
